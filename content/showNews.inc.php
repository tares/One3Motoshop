                   		<p>
                        	The Italian motorcycle manufacturer who is currently the sales leader of the middle weight supersport class has decided to return to racing on the world stage and is convinced that they have joined forces with the ideal partner: ParkinGO. The two companies will be joined together in a three year contract.
The program will debut the MV Agusta F3 675 in the 2013 world Supersport class together with additional racing activity development. The project will place the three cylinder bike from Varese in the able hands of the race technicians whom have already won the World Supersport Championship in 2011 and were contenders in the 2012 World Superbike Championship.

                        	The ParkinGO Team have helped bring about this dream project building a long term link to the historic Italian motorcycle manufacturer whom have in the past accumulated 37 world championship titles, a number of which together with Giacomo Agostini.

                        	The signature of the contract arrived on the day of Claudio Castiglioni’s birthday, whom would be 65 years old today. This is clearly a sign that goes beyond mere coincidence and continues to convey the passion for racing that has always been synonymous with the motorcycle icon.

                        	Giovanni Castiglioni – Presidente MV Agusta: “To be able to reach this agreement with ParkinGO  is personally very satisfying. Taking into account the passion for racing that I have inherited from my father, this is a very emotional decision and I am looking forward to the challenges that will inevitably need to be overcome. Together with Engineer Bordi’s experience, who personally plays a very important role in this project, I am convinced that there are all the elements needed to achieve our goals.”

From our very first encounter with MV there has been a tremendous feeling and understanding between our management teams, our common vision with regards to this project has been an important element that allowed us to join together in this partnership.”
